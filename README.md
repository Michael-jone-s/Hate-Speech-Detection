**Hate Statement Detection**

  -The aim of this project is to review machine learning (ML) algorithms and techniques for hate speech detection in social media (SM). Hate speech problem is normally model as a text classification task.
  
  -Online hate speech is an important issue that breaks the cohesiveness of online social communities and even raises public safety concerns in our societies.
  
  -Motivated by this rising issue, researchers have developed many traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to detect hate speech in online social platforms automatically.
